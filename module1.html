    <h1>
        What, How, Why of Phishing
    </h1>

    <p>
        Phishing is a type of cyber attack that targets individuals by sending an email or other message that appears to be from a legitimate source. 
        The goal is to trick individuals into sharing personal or financial information, or to infect their devices with malware. 
        Phishing attacks can have devastating consequences, but there are steps you can take to protect yourself. 
        This module will help you understand what phishing is, how it works, and why it is so important to be aware of this type of cyber threat.

    <h2>
        What is Phishing?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Phishing is a cyber attack where criminals trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, and more by pretending to be a credible and trustworthy source. 
        Phishing attacks can take many forms, including emails, text messages, and phone calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        The two main types of phishing are email and spear phishing, but donâ€™t be fooled; there are many more, but those two are the most common.
        The difference between email phishing and spear phishing is that email phishing is basically when an email mimics how a legitimate email would look. 
        Spear phishing is customized spoof emails that appear from trusted sources and ask recipients to part with confidential information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another type is lateral phishing, but it falls under the category of email phishing. Lateral phishing is a phishing campaign executed by an external threat- such as a hacker- but the email is sent from a school district's compromised account to other accounts within the organization. 
        In the case of K-12 school districts, email is sent from a student, staff, or faculty member's hijacked account. (Narahari, 2019)

    <h2>
        How Does Phishing Work?
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You get a message that appears to come from a credible source/company.
        </li>
        <li>
            The message includes a link that requests you to provide details or click to resolve an issue. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once you succumb to the link and either click it or provide the information, suddenly, your personal data may be compromised, or malware could have been installed on your device. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Why is Phishing Important?
    </h2>

    <p>
        Phishing is important because it is one of the most common cyber threats. 
        Phishing poses a significant threat in educational settings. 
        It poses a danger to individuals as it takes advantage of their trust and weaknesses. 
        When a school district is attacked, access to payroll systems, student schedules, and email services is restricted, disrupting the daily operations of the school. 
        Additionally, many attacks have an additional objective: to infiltrate data and reveal sensitive or secured information that can be viewed, shared, and used as ransom. 
        Typically, school districts do not have robust security measures due to small IT departments and major budget limitations, making them a huge target.
