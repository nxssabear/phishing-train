        Spot & Stop Phishing
    </h1>

    <p>
        Some red flags that should be considered when determining if an email is phishing or not are:

    </p>

    <ul class="star-list">
        <li>Check for grammar (misspelled words, punctuation, threatening language, etc).</li>
        <li>If your receipt name is not present (e.g., “Hello, nice to meet you.”)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It should be “Hello, [Your Name], nice to meet you.”
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If an attachment has an outdated company logo.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Or perhaps you weren't anticipating an attachment in the first place.                 </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Suspicious URLS (Hyperlinks could be fake and hidden behind realistic display text)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The link doesn’t match what it claims to be. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The sender’s email address isn’t from the correct domain or is suspicious.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The email says they’re from Microsoft, but the domain ending is not coming from a Microsoft account. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Email address being used (is it .edu or .com)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the sender is unknown, be extra cautious of what you’re clicking on in the email.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Treat it as in real-life stranger danger 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there Google complaints about the sender?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Have they been sighted as a fraud before?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is the signature blocked?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
